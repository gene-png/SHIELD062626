/**
 * SMOKE_TEST.md section 11 (T8): the C3 "documents are stale" nudge.
 *
 * Work Order C3 flags an assessment `documents_stale` the moment an AI run
 * changes scores after the deliverable was last generated, and clears the flag
 * when the deliverable is finalised / exported. The admin workspace surfaces
 * that flag as a StaleDocsNudge ("The AI has updated scores since the documents
 * were last generated. Regenerate the deliverable / export to refresh them.").
 *
 * We drive it on the seeded Atlas ATT&CK service because its Run AI needs no
 * Working-Profile seed (unlike CSF) and its run/finalise pair toggles the flag
 * unconditionally (apps/api/app/routes/attack.py:533 sets it, :860 clears it).
 * The seeded assessment is RELEASED (read-only), so we first mint a fresh DRAFT
 * — which starts NOT stale — exactly as s5-attack does.
 *
 * Assertions read the flag through a full page reload (committed-DB truth),
 * which the s5/s6 race notes established as the robust signal under next-dev +
 * React StrictMode double-loads.
 */
