## Context

<recent_commits>
!`git log --oneline -5`
</recent_commits>

<current_status>
!`git status --short`
</current_status>

<current_diff>
!`git diff HEAD`
</current_diff>

## Instructions

1. Read the diff above.
2. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
3. Write a commit message following Conventional Commits format:
   - `feat:` new functionality
   - `fix:` bug fix
   - `test:` adding or updating tests
   - `refactor:` restructuring without behaviour change
   - `chore:` tooling, config, dependencies

   Subject line: imperative mood, under 72 chars, lowercase after the type prefix.
   If the change is non-trivial, add a short body (1–3 lines) explaining the *why*.

4. If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided, use it as guidance for the message.

5. Commit with the message.

Show me the final commit message before committing and confirm once done.
