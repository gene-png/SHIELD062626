# Changelog

All notable changes to SHIELD by Kentro v2.0. Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the phase template in AI Prompt §9.

> **Version renumber (Sprint 3 docs truth pass):** two releases were both
> headed `[3.0.0]`. The v2 work order (PR #1) keeps `[3.0.0]`; Sprint 1
> (smoke sweep) is now `[3.0.1]` and Sprint 2 (findings burn-down, formerly
> `[3.0.1]`) is now `[3.0.2]`. No tags existed for the collided numbers.

## [3.4.1] · Sprint 8 · Prove it in the browser (eyeball-debt burn-down) · 2026-07-21

Branch `feat/browser-proof-sprint-8`. Eight tasks (T0 through T7). The sprint
converts human-eyeball SMOKE debt into committed Playwright specs and pays the
last mint-route debt. It is a patch release: regression and browser proof plus
one backward-compatible idempotency fix, no new user-facing surface. Version is
tag and CHANGELOG level only; package manifests are untouched.

The sprint's most consequential outcome was an out-of-plan product bug fix, and
it is the reason the browser proof mattered:

- **Fixed: MFA sign-in never revealed the TOTP field in the browser (`f10b803`).**
  The web `SignInForm` sent `totp: undefined` into `signIn()`. next-auth
  serializes credentials through `URLSearchParams`, which coerced that
  `undefined` to the literal string `"undefined"`, defeating the `!totp` guard in
  `authorize()`. The MFA branch then verified a bogus code, returned a generic
  `credentials` failure instead of `mfa_required`, and the second-step code field
  never appeared. The fix sends `totp` only when it is present
  (`...(totp ? { totp } : {})`); the backend and `@auth/core` were correct all
  along. The new T4 browser spec surfaced it. The Sprint-7 vitest had missed it
  because that test mocks `signIn()`. A vitest guard now asserts an empty-code
  submit omits the `totp` key. This was a launch-blocker for MFA (D-027) and the
  clearest payoff of the whole sprint: a flow that unit tests called green was
  broken for every real user.
- **Shared MailHog reader helper (T0, `3b7bfb7`):** extracted the inline MailHog
  reader from `s21-email-verify.spec.ts` into `e2e/helpers/mailhog.ts`
  (`MAILHOG_API`, `fetchLatestMessage`, `extractToken`, `subjectOf`), and upgraded
  the search to poll by recipient plus expected subject so registration mail no
  longer wins a first-message race. s21 consumes the helper with zero behavior
  change.
- **Tech-debt extract draft-exists guard (T1, `4396f60`; e2e follow-up
  `b4fe0ba`):** a second POST to the tech-debt extract route while a draft is open
  now returns that draft with an idempotent 200 _before_ `extract_capabilities()`
  runs, so a double-click fires no second LLM call, writes no second audit row,
  and preserves consultant edits. This ports the CSF/attack/zt pattern to the last
  route that still minted unbounded versions on every POST.
  `test_extract_versions_subsequent_lists` was deliberately re-contracted to prove
  versioning across the APPROVED/RELEASED boundary instead. The e2e follow-up
  realigned `s4-techdebt.spec.ts` to the new contract (it now approves any open
  draft before upload so extract mints a fresh draft). No new D-number: this
  applies an existing pattern.
- **Release notification visible in MailHog (T2, `d023226`):**
  `s22-release-notify.spec.ts` creates an isolated tenant and a unique-email
  client user, finalizes and releases a CSF deliverable, then asserts via the T0
  helper that the notification lands in MailHog for that client with the release
  subject and the `/documents` link. It proves recipient selection for real, which
  the four stubbed-sender unit tests could not (SMOKE §29).
- **Verify / forgot / reset pages driven in the browser (T3, `442fca5`):**
  `s23-auth-pages.spec.ts` registers a unique-email user, pulls the verification
  token from MailHog, confirms the address on `/verify-email`, requests a reset on
  `/forgot-password`, completes it on `/reset-password`, and signs in with the new
  password. s21 stays as the API-path proof; s23 proves the pages.
- **MFA enrollment + TOTP sign-in (T4, `f70a8cc`):** `s24-mfa.spec.ts` part A adds
  an `otpauth` TOTP generator to the e2e harness, enrolls a fresh user on
  `/account` with a generated code, asserts the recovery codes are shown once, and
  signs in through the UI TOTP second step. This is the spec that surfaced the
  `f10b803` MFA bug.
- **Recovery-code sign-in, single-use (T5, `1e782de`):** `s24-mfa.spec.ts` part B,
  a self-contained test with its own fresh user, redeems one recovery code at the
  sign-in TOTP step, then proves the same code is rejected on reuse. Together T4
  and T5 retire the manual MFA walkthrough.
- **Admin-health matrix + `/documents` empty state (T6, `57277ea`):**
  `s25-admin-health.spec.ts` signs in as admin and asserts the all-green
  `/admin/health` operator matrix against the live dev stack;
  `s17-documents.spec.ts` gained an empty-state assertion in a fresh per-run
  throwaway tenant, proving the no-dead-ends state (SMOKE §17) that the persistent
  s17 tenant can never show because it always carries a released row.
- **Wrap-up (T7, this commit):** SMOKE_TEST boxes checked only with their proving
  spec filename (§29 release-notify via s22, verify/forgot/reset pages via s23,
  MFA UI via s24, `/admin/health` via s25, `/documents` empty state via s17); this
  CHANGELOG `[3.4.1]` entry; BUILD_REPORT synced to HEAD; the `CONTEXT.md`
  snapshot; and `context/dave.md` refreshed. Unit-proven backend-invariant boxes
  (§16 release deny paths, §20 preview internals, §21 audit filters) and the
  end-of-file sign-off boxes stay unchecked: nothing this sprint proves them in a
  browser.

No new migrations. No new DECISIONS. e2e spec files grew from 21 to 25 (s22, s23,
s24, s25 added; s17 gained the empty-state test).

## [3.4.0] — Sprint 7 · GCP live path + close the client loop — 2026-07-16

Branch `feat/gcp-vertex-sprint-7`. Seven tasks (T0–T6). The sprint proves the
live-AI path against a **real** provider with no static key — Vertex AI via
Application Default Credentials (D-029) — validated end-to-end on Dave's box
across all five AI purposes; closes the client loop with a release-notification
email (D-030); turns dev/CI email delivery on by default so the MailHog flow is
real in every run; finishes the Sprint-5 stale-fetch (`reqSeq`) guard sweep; and
migrates the web auth stack from next-auth v4 to Auth.js v5, clearing the
`uuid@8.3.2` moderate advisory. New user-facing surface (release notification) +
a real GCP live path justify the **minor** bump. All exit gates green: the full
Playwright suite, `pytest -m unit`, web `tsc --noEmit`, in-container web vitest,
in-container web eslint, host prettier `--check` (3.9.5), and in-container
ruff/black (root-config parity).

- **Vertex AI provider adapter via ADC (T0, `7dcf159`):** added a live
  `VertexProvider` beside `GeminiProvider` in `app/ai/llm.py`, selected by
  `SHIELD_LLM_PROVIDER=vertex`. It calls the regional
  `{region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` `generateContent` endpoint and
  authenticates with **Application Default Credentials — no static API key**;
  `google-auth` is a real `apps/api` dep (rebuild the image). The bearer token
  never appears in logs, `llm_calls.error_message`, or exception text (it rides
  the header, not the URL — a unit test locks it). `gemini` (API key,
  `generativelanguage`) and `vertex` (ADC, `aiplatform`) speak the identical
  `generateContent` schema, so body-build/parse are factored into shared helpers.
  `live_llm_readiness()` for `vertex` requires `GCP_PROJECT_ID` set, `google-auth`
  importable, AND ADC resolvable — a loud boot `RuntimeError` otherwise (D-026
  parity); `/admin/ai-status` + `/ready` inherit it. Compose bind-mounts the host
  gcloud config dir read-only; ADC is never copied into the repo or image. See
  DECISIONS **D-029**.
- **GCP live validation sweep + SMOKE §14 GCP annotation (T1, `329f9a5`):** ran
  the sprint's is-it-real payoff — all five AI purposes through the redaction seam
  against real Vertex (`vertex`/`gemini-2.5-flash`, ADC-only) on Dave's box. The
  sweep surfaced and fixed **two adapter defects** no keyless unit test had
  exercised, both now `pytest -m unit` locked: (1) `google-auth`'s token-refresh
  transport hard-requires `requests`, so the dep is now `google-auth[requests]`;
  (2) gemini-2.5 "thinking" spent an unbounded slice of `maxOutputTokens` and
  truncated the longer drafts mid-JSON, silently returned as "completed" — fixed
  with a **loud `finishReason` guard** (non-STOP now raises at the parse seam),
  the output cap raised 4096→8192, and a bounded `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`
  (2048) for gemini-2.5+ only. SMOKE_TEST §14/§14.1 annotated GCP-validated
  2026-07-15 (opt-in spec is the proof, CI-skipped keyless). `.env` reverted to
  fixture; a keyless run self-skips clean. See DECISIONS **D-029** addendum.
- **Client release notification email (T2, `4420b53`):** the shared
  `release_deliverable` helper (behind all four services + risk register) now
  emails **every active client-role user of the deliverable's tenant** on release
  when delivery is on — carrying the service, title/version, and a
  `{WEB_BASE_URL}/documents` link. Best-effort: delivery-off releases behave
  exactly as v3.3.0 (loud skip log); a per-recipient SMTP failure is logged loudly
  and the release **still stands** (release is the source of truth — a
  notification failure must never roll it back). Cross-tenant users and admins are
  never notified. Four `pytest -m unit` tests
  (`test_release_notification.py`). See DECISIONS **D-030**.
- **Enable email delivery in dev/CI compose (T3, `d95f5c7`):** flipped
  `SHIELD_EMAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED` default to `true` in `docker-compose.yml`
  (SMTP → the `mailhog` service, so boot never refuses) so the registration /
  verify / reset email loop is real in every dev and CI run and
  `s21-email-verify.spec.ts` **runs** instead of self-skipping.
  `SHIELD_AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFY` stays `false` — flipping it would break every
  e2e sign-in (seeded/spec users are unverified); enforcement remains a
  deploy-time choice. The CI `e2e` job comment notes MailHog is now exercised.
- **reqSeq stale-fetch guard sweep remainder (T4, `37f9bd6`):** finished the
  Sprint-5 carry-over — swept the admin workspaces/panels the 14 react-hooks rules
  did not force, applying a `reqSeq` guard **only** where a stale mount-fetch
  response can clobber newer state (each edit justified in the commit body, no
  speculative guards). Vitest guards added for the two highest-traffic
  newly-guarded components (deferred-promise pattern).
- **Auth.js (next-auth) v5 migration (T5, `3de0626`):** migrated web auth from
  `next-auth@4.24.14` to Auth.js v5 (`next-auth@5.0.0-beta.31` + `@auth/core`).
  `lib/auth/options.ts` now owns `NextAuth()` and exports
  `{handlers, auth, signIn, signOut}`; the `[...nextauth]` route re-exports the
  handlers; 34 `getServerSession(authOptions)` call sites moved to `auth()`. The
  MFA signal is re-wired for v5 (every credentials failure normalizes to
  `CredentialsSignin`, so the password-ok-need-TOTP branch throws a subclass whose
  `code='mfa_required'` surfaces via `signIn(redirect:false).code`; `SignInForm`
  reads `result.code`, not `result.error`). Behavior-identical: auth e2e green.
  `pnpm audit`: the `uuid@8.3.2` moderate is **gone** (`uuid` no longer in the
  lockfile); only the documented `postcss` moderate remains. New
  `SignInForm.test.tsx` locks the code-based MFA signal. BUILD_REPORT audit
  posture updated.
- **Wrap-up (T6, this commit):** SMOKE_TEST §14 GCP annotation (T1), §25 checked
  via the now-running `s21` (T3), new §29 release-notification section (T2) — boxes
  only where a green committed spec proves it (honesty convention); this
  `[3.4.0]` CHANGELOG entry; BUILD_REPORT synced (Vertex in the provider matrix,
  post-T5 audit posture, gate results); DECISIONS D-029/D-030 verified landed;
  full exit gate set green; CONTEXT.md end-of-sprint snapshot; `context/dave.md`
  refreshed.

## [3.3.0] — Sprint 6 · real demo — 2026-07-12

Branch `feat/real-demo-sprint-6`. Twelve tasks (T0–T11) turning the platform
into a real, self-standing demo: the live-AI path is now runnable and fails
loudly at boot when misconfigured, seeded deliverables actually download, real
TOTP MFA and real email verification + password reset ship on the custom-JWT
stack (the D-020 boot-refusals are gone — the flags now gate enforcement), a
full-matrix `/ready` + `/admin/health` operator view lands, the demo seed tells
a coherent downloadable Atlas story with a one-command reset, and a hosted-demo
compose runs web as a production build. New user-facing auth features + a runnable
live path justify the **minor** bump. All exit gates green: the full Playwright
suite, `pytest -m unit`, web `tsc --noEmit`, in-container web vitest, host
prettier `--check` (3.9.5), in-container ruff/black (root-config parity), and the
in-container web eslint gate.

- **Live-AI enablement + boot preflight (T0, `8aebe51`):** declared
  `anthropic>=0.40,<1` as a real `apps/api` runtime dep (the `AnthropicProvider`
  lazy-imports it, so an undeclared SDK surfaced only as an `ImportError` on the
  first live Run-AI — the image must be rebuilt, not just restarted); replaced the
  stale default model `claude-opus-4-7` (invalid → 404) with `claude-sonnet-5` in
  `config.py` + `docker-compose.yml`; added a live-mode boot preflight
  (`Settings.live_llm_readiness()` → `assert_safe_for_runtime()` raises a loud
  `RuntimeError` at lifespan when the key is missing / SDK unimportable / model a
  placeholder), also surfaced via `GET /admin/ai-status`. Fixture mode unaffected.
  See DECISIONS **D-026**.
- **Live-AI integration test + SMOKE §14 (T1, `a19fded`):** codified the
  2026-07-12 manual smoke as a committed opt-in spec
  (`apps/api/tests/live/test_live_ai.py`, `@pytest.mark.live`) + a one-command
  `scripts/smoke_live_ai.py`. The `live` marker is registered and EXCLUDED from
  `-m unit` and CI; both self-skip without `SHIELD_LLM_MODE=live` + a key, so the
  loop/CI stay green keyless. SMOKE_TEST §14 annotated as validated by the opt-in
  spec + documented procedure (not falsely checked as CI-green).
- **Seed → storage parity (T2, `0bbabac`):** the demo seed obtained its backend
  from `get_storage()` (not a direct `LocalFilesystemStorage`) so it writes where
  the API reads (MinIO under compose); `tech_debt/extract.py`'s local-path
  shortcut routed through the storage protocol uniformly. e2e: after `down -v` +
  reseed, the seeded Atlas client downloads a SEEDED released deliverable → 200
  with the §15.5 filename (410 before the fix). `s17-documents.spec.ts` gained the
  parity test.
- **Full dependency-health readiness + operator view (T3, `9b2c74b`):** `/ready`
  moved from a DB-only `SELECT 1` to a per-dependency matrix (db, redis, minio,
  keycloak-dormant, LLM readiness reusing the T0 preflight); any down required
  dependency flips `ready=false` and names the offender while `/health` liveness
  stays cheap. New `/admin/health` operator page (`HealthMatrix`) renders the
  matrix with an all-green / degraded overall badge (vitest-covered).
- **Real TOTP MFA (T4, `bf8e7c6`):** migration `0030` (additive/C0) adds
  `users.mfa_totp_secret` (Fernet-encrypted, nullable) + a `user_recovery_codes`
  table. RFC 6238 TOTP against the stdlib (`app/security/totp.py`, locked to the
  RFC vectors — no OTP dep); `POST /auth/mfa/enroll` (otpauth URI + secret),
  `/auth/mfa/verify` (confirm + 10 one-time recovery codes shown once), and
  `/auth/mfa/verify-login` (completes the short-lived `mfa_pending` challenge).
  The D-020 boot-refusal on `SHIELD_AUTH_REQUIRE_MFA` is removed — the flag now
  GATES enforcement. Web: sign-in MFA step + a net-new account enrollment section.
  See DECISIONS **D-027**.
- **Real email verification + password reset (T5, `f67c79f`):** migration `0031`
  (additive/C0) adds an `email_tokens` table (SHA-256 hash only, purpose, expiry,
  used-at). Registration mints a verification token + sends the email;
  `/auth/verify-email`, `/auth/resend-verification`, `/auth/forgot-password`,
  `/auth/reset-password` — single-use, time-bounded, enumeration-safe. The SMTP
  sender is gated by `SHIELD_EMAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED` (off = logged no-op so the
  flow works in dev/tests; on without `SMTP_HOST` refuses to boot). The D-020
  boot-refusal on `SHIELD_AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFY` is removed — the flag now
  gates login. Web: net-new verify-email / forgot-password / reset-password pages.
  e2e via MailHog (opt-in, self-skips). See DECISIONS **D-028**.
- **OpenAI reasoning-model token param (T6, `19636b5`):** the OpenAI adapter now
  sends the correct output-token-limit key per model family
  (`max_completion_tokens` for reasoning/responses models, legacy `max_tokens`
  otherwise) instead of always `max_tokens`. Deferred item from Sprint 4 D-024;
  `test_llm_providers.py` updated (httpx monkeypatched, no live key).
- **Live-AI parity sweep — all five purposes (T7, `8761d91`):** extended the T1
  opt-in spec from csf-only to a parametrized sweep over `csf_score`, `zt_score`,
  `mitre_map`, `risk_synthesize`, `tech_debt_extract` — each plants identical
  canonical PII (twice each) and asserts a complete live `llm_calls` row,
  `redacted_counts == {email:2, name:2, client_org:2}`, no PII, AND that the
  response parses into the route-layer container (the per-adapter parse check).
  Still `@pytest.mark.live`, self-skips keyless. SMOKE_TEST §14.1 documents it.
- **Demo data realism + one-command reset (T8, `39b3cfc`):** the seed now
  synthesizes a coherent Atlas Risk Register (7 hand-authored entries whose tiers
  are ALWAYS code-derived via `risk.engine.tier_for`, real ATT&CK + CSF codes) and
  exports XLSX/PDF/Word through `get_storage()`; tech-debt items gained believable
  per-tool disposition rationales. New `scripts/demo-reset.(ps1|sh)`: `down -v` →
  `up -d --build` → poll `/ready` full-matrix → seed → print URLs+creds (documented
  in README + ONBOARDING). `s8-risk-register.spec.ts` gained a read-only test
  proving the seeded register's code-derived tiers + downloadable exports.
- **Hosted-demo compose (T9, `db33372`):** `docker-compose.demo.yml` is a thin
  override redefining only the web service as a production Next standalone build
  (`shield-web:demo`, `volumes: !reset []`, `node apps/web/server.js`,
  `NODE_ENV=production`), fixture-by-default. Scope expansion: added a root
  `.dockerignore` + rewrote `apps/web/Dockerfile` (it had never built cleanly), and
  fixed a latent CI lint failure in `HealthMatrix.tsx` (react-hooks
  set-state-in-effect) that the loop gate set had let slip. Cloud/terraform NOT
  touched.
- **Security + audit pass (T10, `18b7d85`):** two findings fixed TDD-first. (1)
  MFA second-factor guesses at both `verify-login` and enroll-confirm now feed the
  SAME account-lockout counter as password failures (and refuse with 423 when
  locked); the counter resets ONLY on a fully successful login (removed the
  premature `_clear_password_failures` on the mfa-challenge / email-not-verified
  branches that let a password-holder evade second-factor lockout). (2) `/ready`
  now reduces per-dependency `detail` to a generic string for anonymous callers
  (LBs/k8s still get statuses + offender names) while authenticated callers get
  full operator detail. Audit scans: bandit exit 0; JS-audit posture carried
  unchanged from Sprint 5 (0 high / 2 documented moderates — no JS manifests
  changed); manual secret-diff scan clean; no secret committed.
- **Wrap-up (T11, this entry):** SMOKE_TEST §22–§28 for live-AI enablement,
  full-matrix health + `/admin/health`, MFA, email verify/reset, seed→storage
  parity + demo realism, hosted-demo compose, and the security hardening — each box
  checked only where a green committed spec proves it, annotated by spec filename;
  key-gated live specs and the MailHog e2e marked opt-in/CI-skipped, not falsely
  checked; CHANGELOG `[3.3.0]`; DECISIONS **D-026/D-027/D-028** verified landed;
  the full exit gate set re-run green; CONTEXT.md end-of-sprint snapshot.

Migrations this sprint: **0030** (MFA TOTP secret + recovery codes, T4) and
**0031** (email verification/reset tokens, T5), both additive and SQLite-safe
(C0). New DECISIONS: **D-026** (live-AI enablement + boot preflight), **D-027**
(real TOTP MFA), **D-028** (real email verification + password reset).

## [3.2.0] — Sprint 5 · client value loop — 2026-07-10

Branch `feat/client-value-loop-sprint-5`. Eleven tasks (T0–T10) turning
consultant output into client-visible value: a deliverable release-to-client
flow, the `/home` executive dashboard with the §2.5 value-loop card, the
`/documents` page, a CSF POA&M action-plan step, a pre-egress redaction preview,
and the first read surface over the append-only audit stores — plus a web
unit-test harness, adoption of the 14 react-hooks v6 rules, and a prettier pin
sync. New client-facing features justify the **minor** bump. All exit gates
green: the full Playwright suite, `pytest -m unit`, web `tsc --noEmit`, host
prettier `--check` (3.9.5), in-container ruff/black (root-config parity), and
the new in-container web vitest gate (T8).

- **Prettier 3.9.5 pin sync (T0, `37330cc`):** landed dependabot #29's
  3.9.4→3.9.5 bump on the sprint branch and synced the four gate pins the bot
  can't touch (CLAUDE.md real-commands, CONTEXT.md machine-local facts, the
  runtime queue `gates` array, and the staged sprint-5 queue). A format gate that
  diverges from the lockfile ships red CI (the Sprint 2 lesson). #29 closed as
  superseded.
- **Deliverable release flow, backend (T1, `1863f9a`):** migration `0028`
  (additive/C0) adds `deliverables.released_at` + `released_by` (nullable; old
  rows parse as unreleased). A shared `app/deliverable_release.py` helper backs
  four per-service `POST /{svc}/deliverables/{id}/release` routes — admin-only,
  requires `finalized_at` (typed 409 `not_finalized`, D-016), idempotent 200
  no-op on re-release with a loud log, audit row `*.deliverable.released`. New
  `GET /clients/{cid}/deliverables` returns ONLY released deliverables of the
  caller's tenant (404 cross-tenant, never 403). Artifact download now admits a
  client for the formats of a released own-tenant deliverable, and nothing else
  (unit-tested allow/deny matrix). The model docstring's "no client release
  path" note is updated by design. See DECISIONS **D-025** (a new admin-only
  release action, explicitly not a revival of the removed D-005/D-006 reviewer
  gate — D-023).
- **`/documents` client page (T2, `dd2ff1b`):** server component
  `app/documents/page.tsx` resolves the tenant (client `client_id` or admin
  active-client cookie) and renders the T1 client list as a table — service
  label, title, version, released date, Final / Superseded badge, per-format
  download links. Client nav gains **Documents**; admin nav unchanged. Empty
  state per the no-dead-ends rule. e2e `s17-documents.spec.ts` (isolated tenant):
  admin finalize+release v1, client sees the row + PDF download 200 with the
  §15.5 filename, unreleased v2 hidden.
- **`/home` client dashboard (T3, `bb981a5`):** server component
  `app/home/page.tsx` fetches existing endpoints only (deliverables, per-service
  intake status, unread messages) — no new scoring. Presentational
  `HomeDashboard`: greeting, a hero band shown ONLY when a released deliverable
  exists (else next-step guidance — no dead ends), a per-service status grid of
  phase labels (report ready / finalizing / under review / in progress / getting
  started — never numbers), waiting-on-you, and recent activity. §6.4 enforced:
  no scoring math, audit internals, or raw AI output. Role landing: a signed-in
  client on `/` redirects to `/home`, admin to `/admin`. e2e
  `s18-home.spec.ts`: hero-absent → release → hero-present, both role landings,
  no-percentage guard.
- **Cross-service value-loop card (T4, `3ccddca`):** `GET
/clients/{cid}/value-summary` — a DETERMINISTIC aggregation over
  already-computed engine outputs (CSF/ZT/ATT&CK gap counts + Tech Debt annual
  savings), no LLM and no new scoring (a unit test asserts zero `llm_calls` rows
  and no `app.ai` import in the module). A service feeds a client-visible number
  ONLY once it has a RELEASED deliverable (spec-12 visibility); otherwise the
  slot is null and the card renders **Pending** — never a fake 0.
  `ValueLoopCard` renders on `/home` when the tenant has any data. e2e
  `s19-value-loop.spec.ts`: no card pre-release → scored+released CSF → gap count
  - Pending, no percentage leak.
- **CSF POA&M / action plan (T5, `2a43a13`):** migration `0029` (additive/C0)
  adds `csf_gap_actions` keyed (assessment_id, subcategory_code), all annotation
  fields nullable (characterization / priority_override / owner / deadline /
  resources / success_criteria / poam_ref). `GET`/`PUT
/csf/services/{sid}/gap-actions[/{code}]` (admin autosave upsert, D-016 typed
  errors). The scoring engine (`playbook.py`) is read-only for the default
  priority (`gap_priority()`); a set `priority_override` wins. The playbook
  **XLSX** gains an **Action Plan** sheet (backward-compatible optional param).
  Admin UI `CsfGapActionEditor` (auto-save on change/blur, reqSeq guard). e2e
  `s7-csf-playbook.spec.ts`: characterize + owner auto-save survive a reload.
- **Redaction preview gate (T6, `0a92110`):** `POST /ai/preview` (admin-only,
  AI-rate-limited) shows the EXACT payload a service's next Run-AI would egress
  AFTER redaction — WITHOUT egress and WITHOUT an `llm_calls` row (no provider is
  ever constructed). Each service's inline run-ai payload build was factored into
  one builder (`build_{csf,zt,attack}_ai_request`) that both run-ai and preview
  call, so preview can never diverge from egress (a no-behavior-change refactor
  the run-ai regression suites lock). TECH_DEBT (file-extract, not state-based)
  returns a typed 422 `preview_unsupported`. Reusable `AiPreviewButton` wired
  into the CSF/ZT/ATT&CK Run-AI surfaces (non-blocking — an offered gate). e2e
  `s7-csf-playbook.spec.ts` asserts preview payload + counts, then a real run.
- **`/admin/audit` viewer (T7, `a14c1b0`):** two admin-only read routes over the
  append-only stores that had 42 write sites and zero readers — `GET
/admin/audit-entries` (filters: action prefix, target_type, actor,
  correlation_id, date range) and `GET /admin/llm-calls` (filters: client_id,
  purpose, provider, status, date range; projects only audit-safe fields, no API
  keys). Keyset cursor pagination on `(at/requested_at desc, id desc)` — no
  OFFSET; a bad cursor is a typed 422. `AuditViewer` is a read-only two-tab UI
  (Activity / AI calls) with per-tab filters and correlation-id click-through
  that links the tabs. e2e `s20-audit.spec.ts`: an in-test `csf.run_ai` appears
  in Activity, its fixture `csf_score` row in AI calls, correlation links them.
- **Web unit-test harness (T8, `3bc2b54`):** stood up vitest +
  `@testing-library/react` + jsdom in `apps/web` (no framework existed before —
  only the root e2e/). `pnpm -F web test` is a single deterministic run with a
  fail-loud fetch stub for unmocked network. Two guard tests lock the two
  stale-fetch `reqSeq` guards (`MessageThread`, `CsfPlaybookPanel`): a stale
  mount GET resolving after a newer request is discarded, and a failed load
  surfaces to `role=alert` — each verified to bite (defeating the guard fails the
  test). The web CI job runs the step, and the in-container web test gate was
  appended to the runtime queue `gates` array (the Sprint-4 T0 pattern).
- **react-hooks v6 adoption (T9, `f590d99`):** enabled all 14
  `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v6 rules that Sprint-4 T3 had configured off for
  flat-config parity — ZERO rules now configured off. `eslint .` surfaced 14
  errors (13 set-state-in-effect + 1 purity); fixed by pattern, not suppression:
  mount-fetch effects wrapped in an async IIFE (the `MessageThread` shape),
  `AuditViewer`'s pre-await setState moved inside a nested async fn, the
  Tier/ZtStage focus-sync effects rewritten as the sanctioned adjust-state-during-render
  pattern, and `SaveStatus`'s render-time `Date.now()` moved into interval-driven
  state. Behavioral edits to shared components validated by the full e2e suite.
- **Wrap-up (T10, this entry):** SMOKE_TEST §16–§21 for the release flow,
  `/documents`, `/home` + value card, POA&M editing, redaction preview, and
  audit viewer — each box checked only where a green committed spec proves it,
  annotated by spec filename; CHANGELOG `[3.2.0]`; BUILD_REPORT synced; DECISIONS
  **D-025** verified landed; the full exit gate set (full e2e, `pytest -m unit`,
  tsc, prettier 3.9.5, in-container ruff/black, web vitest) re-run green;
  CONTEXT.md end-of-sprint snapshot.

Migrations this sprint: **0028** (deliverable release fields, T1) and **0029**
(`csf_gap_actions`, T5), both additive and SQLite-safe (C0). New DECISIONS:
**D-025** (deliverable release-to-client as a new admin-only action).

## [3.1.0] — Sprint 4 · framework majors + multi-provider LLM — 2026-07-09

Branch `feat/majors-providers-sprint-4`. The D-018 framework-majors bundle
deferred from Sprint 2/3 landed one major at a time with the full Playwright
suite as the regression net, plus multi-provider LLM egress. The bundle of
runtime/framework majors (Next 14→15, React 18→19, Tailwind 3→4, ESLint 8→9,
Node 20→22) justifies the **minor** version bump. All exit gates green: the
full e2e suite (34 tests), `pytest -m unit`, web `tsc --noEmit`, host prettier
`--check` (lockfile-pinned 3.9.4), and the new in-container ruff/black gate
(root-config parity, T0).

- **Lint-gate CI parity (T0, `4c068d0`):** Sprint 3's only red CI was 6
  ruff/black findings the loop never saw — CI runs from a full checkout where
  config discovery walks up to the ROOT `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]`, but the
  api container mounts only `apps/api`, so in-container runs silently used
  defaults. Fixed with a read-only compose mount of the root config into the
  api service (parent of `/app`, so discovery finds it naturally); the
  `ruff check --no-cache . && black --check .` gate is now in the runtime queue
  `gates` array and documented in CLAUDE.md. The loop's lint gate now equals
  CI's.
- **Next 15 + React 19 (T1, `77bd360`):** bumped `next` → 15.5.20, `react` /
  `react-dom` → 19.2.7 (plus `@types/react*` and `eslint-config-next`) together;
  ran the official `@next/codemod`. Reviewed the breaking surfaces that touch
  us: async request APIs (`cookies()`/`headers()` in `app/api/proxy/*` routes)
  and the fetch/route-handler caching default change (the app relies on dynamic
  rendering — each proxy route verified). `next-auth` 4.24.x runs on Next 15
  without forcing the Auth.js v5 migration (verified sign-in/session/middleware
  early). The full e2e suite is green on the new stack; the `next < 15.5.16`
  advisories that dominated the root audit are cleared.
- **Tailwind 4 (T2, `f6d816a`):** CSS-first migration — `@tailwindcss/postcss`
  plugin, `@theme` in CSS replacing most of `tailwind.config`, breaking utility
  renames swept across `apps/web/src` and `packages/`. The
  `packages/design-system/src/tokens.css` custom properties survive; the s16 axe
  sweep asserts the Sprint 2 `--ink-tertiary` contrast fix still holds. Full
  e2e + axe green; in-container `pnpm -F web build` clean.
- **ESLint 9 flat config (T3, `bf82fd2`):** migrated `apps/web` to
  `eslint.config.js` flat config on ESLint 9 (9.39.4) with
  `eslint-config-next` 16's `./core-web-vitals` flat export, preserving the
  exact 47-rule set from the old `next/core-web-vitals` (verified via
  `eslint --print-config` diff); old `.eslintrc*` deleted, prettier compat kept.
  **ESLint 10 is honestly deferred upstream** (Dave decision 2026-07-09,
  superseding SPRINT_4.md's ESLint-10 target): no published Next lint stack runs
  on 10 today — `eslint-plugin-react` 7.37.5 uses the removed
  `context.getFilename()` and Next's compiled babel parser hits an
  `eslint-scope` `scopeManager.addGlobals` gap. Revisit when
  `eslint-plugin-react` ships v10 support. See DECISIONS **D-018** annotation.
- **Node 22 (T4, `bf6ccdd`):** `node:20-bookworm-slim` → `node:22-bookworm-slim`
  in the three `apps/web/Dockerfile` stages, `node:20-bookworm` → `node:22`
  compose web image, `engines.node >= 22` in the web package.json, both CI
  `setup-node` steps (web + e2e jobs) to `22`, and the ONBOARDING host-Node
  note. Web force-recreated on node 22.23.1; full e2e green on the rebuilt
  stack. Deliberately after T1–T3 so a Node failure would not be confounded with
  framework breakage.
- **Audit to zero (T5, `987a4f2`):** root `pnpm audit` reports 0 critical / 0
  high (T1's Next 15 cleared the 17 `next < 15.5.16` advisories); `e2e/` `npm
audit` 0 total. Two root **moderates** are deliberately left open and
  documented: `postcss` 8.4.31 (pinned inside `next@15.5.20`; the XSS-stringify
  path only fires on untrusted CSS, N/A at build time) and `uuid` 8.3.2 (via
  `next-auth@4.24.14`; the buffer-bounds bug is v3/v5/v6-only). Neither is
  overridden — forcing a bump would risk regressing the e2e-validated stack for
  zero real security gain; both clear on the upstream / Auth.js v5 bumps.
  `dependabot.yml` D-018 major-suppression posture is unchanged (this sprint IS
  that plan executing); only the stale policy comment was refreshed.
- **Multi-provider LLM egress (T6, `05121de`):** live `OpenAIProvider`
  (chat/completions) and `GeminiProvider` (`generateContent`) added beside
  `AnthropicProvider` in `app/ai/llm.py`, both thin `httpx` adapters (no new SDK
  dependency). `_build_provider` now routes `anthropic`/`openai`/`gemini`;
  `azure_openai`/`bedrock`/`local` stay loud not-implemented `RuntimeError`s. The
  egress contract above the seam is untouched — redaction, the `llm_calls` audit
  row (provider/model/client_id), and "AI suggests, code computes" all unchanged;
  adapters only translate prompt+redacted-payload → provider REST → text+tokens.
  New settings `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` (empty default); a missing key
  for the selected provider raises the same loud `RuntimeError` at construction
  as Anthropic. `SHIELD_LLM_MODEL` stays the single model knob. 11 new unit tests
  (`test_llm_providers.py`) monkeypatch `httpx` — request shape, response
  parsing, token counts, missing-key raise, unimplemented-provider raise, and
  HTTP 500 → `llm_calls` status=failed — with **no** live calls. Fixture mode
  stays the default and byte-identical deterministic (D-017 untouched). Docs:
  README AI provider matrix, `docs/architecture.md` AI-flow matrix, SMOKE_TEST
  §14 rewritten provider-agnostic, DECISIONS **D-024**.
- **MessageThread stale-fetch race (T8, `67e79ad`):** `MessageThread.onSend`
  POSTed a message (201, row in DB, draft cleared) but a slow mount-time `load()`
  GET could resolve after the POST-append and `setMessages(rows)` would clobber
  the just-sent message. Fixed with the `efcbbfc` request-sequence-guard pattern
  — a `reqSeq` ref, only the newest GET writes state, and `onSend` bumps the seq
  so an in-flight mount GET is discarded. s9-messaging now green
  deterministically (previously a deterministic failure in isolation).
- **Checkpoint fixes:** checkpoint 1 (`efcbbfc`) fixed the same class of
  stale-fetch race in `CsfPlaybookPanel` breaking s7 (request-sequence guard +
  content-aware spec waiter — the pattern T8 reused); checkpoint 2 was a clean
  pass at `05121de` (full e2e green, security clean) with no fix needed.
- **Wrap-up (T7, this entry):** SMOKE_TEST §14 provider-agnostic wording
  verified landed (T6); BUILD_REPORT A06 row updated to the zero-audit state;
  CHANGELOG `[3.1.0]`; CONTEXT.md end-of-sprint snapshot.
- **Post-sprint audit hardening:** the end-of-sprint deep + security audit
  fixed three items on this branch. (1) **Security:** `GeminiProvider` now sends
  its API key via the `x-goog-api-key` header instead of a `?key=` URL query
  param — the query form leaked the key into httpx's `HTTPStatusError` message,
  which `LLMClient.invoke` persists to `llm_calls.error_message` and the logs on
  any HTTP failure. A new `test_gemini_http_error_records_failed_row` asserts the
  FAILED row and that the key is absent from `error_message`. (2) **Fail loudly:**
  `CsfPlaybookPanel`'s post-edit refresh no longer swallows a failed reload as a
  console-only unhandled rejection — errors now surface via `setError` like the
  other reload callers. (3) **Egress cleanup:** internal `__`-prefixed control
  keys (`__purpose__`) are stripped from the payload before it reaches a live
  provider (new `_egress_payload`); the misleading "real providers ignore it"
  comment is corrected. The ESLint-10 deferral now also carries a dated
  annotation on **D-018** in DECISIONS.md.

## [3.0.3] — Sprint 3 · audit correctness & honesty — 2026-07-09

Branch `fix/audit-correctness-sprint-3`. Eight tasks (T0–T7) burning down the
correctness, security, and truth-in-docs findings from the 2026-07-08 deep repo
audit (`docs/audits/2026-07-08-repo-audit.md`). All exit gates green: the full
Playwright suite (16 files / 34 tests), `pytest -m unit`, web `tsc --noEmit`,
and the newly-mandatory repo-wide prettier `--check` (lockfile-pinned 3.9.4).

- **CSF live-mode Run-AI fixed (T0, `03175f8`):** `_CSF_SCORE_PROMPT` asked the
  model for a `{subcategories:[…]}` shape the route never parsed (it reads
  `scores[]` keyed on tier + subcategory_code) — live mode silently discarded a
  compliant response. Aligned the prompt to the parser's shape and grounded the
  payload in the assessment's interview answers/evidence (mirroring ZT), with a
  loud warning when a Run-AI parses to zero changes. Fixture determinism (D-017)
  untouched; a contract test locks the schema.
- **Draft-exists guard ported to ATT&CK + ZT (T1, `4056170`):** the attack mint
  (~600 coverage rows/version) and zt mint (~87 rows) shared CSF's old
  unbounded-version bug. Both now return the open DRAFT idempotently (HTTP 200)
  and only cut v+1 after the prior draft closes; tech_debt has no equivalent
  mint. Two new contract tests; s5/s6/s11 close-then-mint for a fresh grid.
- **Auth compensating controls made honest (T2, `bc491b9`):** README/BUILD_REPORT
  claimed daily forced re-auth + 30-min idle timeout that nothing enforced. Now
  real: an `auth_time` claim rides refreshes and `/auth/refresh` returns a typed
  401 `reauth_required` past `SHIELD_FORCED_REAUTH_SECONDS` (24h default);
  refresh-token rotation via `users.active_refresh_jti` (migration 0026, C0) so a
  replayed refresh token is rejected (`refresh_reused`); dead `require_mfa` /
  `require_email_verify` flags now refuse boot instead of silently no-op'ing; web
  shows a friendly session-expired banner. See DECISIONS **D-020**.
- **Rate limiting on auth + run-AI (T3, `b48a39f`):** new `app/security/rate_limit.py`
  — fixed-window Redis counters, per-IP + per-account on login/register (checked
  before Argon2), per-client on the five run-AI endpoints. Over-limit → typed 429
  `rate_limited` (D-016) + `Retry-After`; a Redis outage fails **open** with a
  loud structlog warning (unit-tested). Redis finally earns its keep. Defaults
  are generous so the serialized e2e suite never trips.
- **Spec §15.5 export filenames (T4, `b14ccd5`):** the CSF Playbook 5-file export
  and Risk Register export bypassed `deliverable_filename()`. Both now route
  through it — e.g. `Atlas_Defense_Solutions_CSF_Playbook070926_v8_Executive.pdf`
  — carrying Company + Service + `MMDDYY` + version (v1 carries no suffix).
- **`llm_calls` tenant attribution (T5, `cea0c5a`):** added nullable
  `llm_calls.client_id` (migration 0027, batch_alter_table + FK, C0) threaded
  through all five call sites so the largest cross-assessment egress (risk
  synthesis) is finally attributable to a tenant.
- **Docs truth pass (T6, `aeac503`):** `docs/architecture.md` rewritten to the
  real system (multi-tenant, no Celery/worker — AI runs synchronously in `api`,
  Redis = rate limiting, two-layer append-only `audit_entries`, one-way redactor
  with no unredact). README phantom runbooks/terraform marked planned-not-present;
  real test matrix. DECISIONS append-only fixes: the duplicate `[3.0.0]` /
  duplicate D-015 heading resolved (Part F → **D-021**, erratum **D-022**),
  D-005/D-006 reviewer-role + release-flow supersession recorded (**D-023**).
  Zero `reviewer` hits remain in `apps/api/app` docstrings/OpenAPI summaries.
  ops/development docs de-fictionalized.
- **Loop hygiene + wrap-up (T7, this entry):** host prettier `format:check` gate
  documented in CLAUDE.md (the Sprint 2 loop shipped unformatted files CI caught);
  SMOKE_TEST §14 flagged as now-meaningful post-T0 but left unchecked (needs
  David's live key) and §10 artifact names synced to the §15.5 convention;
  CONTEXT.md end-of-sprint snapshot.

## [3.0.2] — Sprint 2 · findings burn-down — 2026-07-07

Branch `fix/findings-burndown-sprint-2`. Ten tasks (T0–T9) burning down the
defect + coverage backlog Sprint 1 surfaced, plus this docs refresh (T10). All
exit gates green: the full 16-file Playwright suite (34 tests — recorded as 32
at the time, corrected in the Sprint 3 audit), `pytest -m unit`, and web
`tsc --noEmit`.

- **Dependency bump (T0, `f580a3b`):** `next` → latest 14.2.x patch (14.2.35;
  stayed on the 14 App-Router line, no 15.x jump). `pnpm audit` clean of
  criticals; the 5 remaining high advisories are 15.x-only fixes documented in
  the commit body as no-non-breaking-fix.
- **Runtime e2e id resolution (T1, `1e6640a`):** new `e2e/helpers/ids.ts`
  (`atlasClientId` / `atlasServiceId`, per-file cached) replaces every hardcoded
  seeded UUID across 8 specs so the suite survives a re-seeded DB. Zero
  hardcoded UUIDs remain under `e2e/` (grep-enforced).
- **Fresh-stack proof + bring-up doc (T2, `64d5b95`):** `down -v` → reseed →
  full suite green on a pristine DB; `e2e/README.md` documents the canonical
  bring-up that T3's CI job automates.
- **CI e2e job (T3, `f0475ce`):** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gains an `e2e` job
  — composed stack up, fail-loud health waits on `:8000` + web, seed, `npm ci` +
  chromium, `playwright test`, `always()` upload of report/traces, 30-min
  timeout — alongside the untouched python/web/secret-scan jobs. First real run
  is pending the review-required branch push (Dave-manual).
- **Runtime axe sweep (T4, `7603799`):** `@axe-core/playwright` + new
  `s16-axe.spec.ts` runs a WCAG A/AA sweep over public/client/admin surfaces
  (zero violations, no rule exclusions). Triage found one recurring contrast
  miss — the `--ink-tertiary` token (2.7–3.0:1) — darkened to ~4.8:1 in
  `packages/design-system/src/tokens.css`.
- **IG Core/Supporting metadata (T5, `ec59f1d`):** imported the real
  per-subcategory Core / Supporting / Alignment classification (108 codes, from
  the Working Profile reference workbook) into `app/csf/catalog.py` as additive
  metadata, threaded into `routes/csf.py` so CSF Playbook Rules 2 (Core+Primary
  floor) and 5 (Supporting/Supplemental override) finally fire. Additive/C0:
  absent codes keep safe defaults; no migration (flags computed at roll-up).
- **a11y roving tabindex + heatmap semantics (T6, `137727b`):** WAI-ARIA
  radiogroup roving tabindex on `TierPicker` / `ZtStagePicker` (arrow keys move
  focus with wrap; select stays on Space/Enter/click to avoid auto-save PATCH
  flooding); risk heatmap `tbody th` gains `scope="row"` so Chromium exposes
  rowheaders.
- **CSF draft-exists guard (T7, `efa87b8`):** `POST
/csf/services/{id}/assessments` now returns the open draft idempotently (HTTP 200) instead of minting an unbounded new version; a new v+1 is only cut once
  the prior draft closes. CSF-scoped; the attack/zt mint routes share the
  pattern and are backlogged.
- **Coverage gaps (T8, `9dbb83f`):** new `s2-management.spec.ts` drives the
  `/admin/management` UI itself (create client, approve/remove domain); `s3`
  gains verbatim CSF outcome-prompt assertions (C8). SMOKE_TEST §2 + §3-verbatim
  checked off.
- **Reserved-TLD guard (T9, `1cdfa89`):** admin add-domain route rejects
  special-use / reserved TLDs (`.test` / `.invalid` / `.localhost`) with a typed
  422 (`domain_reserved_tld`, D-016 envelope), reusing email-validator's own
  reserved-name check rather than a hand-rolled list. The web Management client
  now surfaces the typed `error.message`. See DECISIONS.md **D-019**.
- **Docs refresh (T10, this entry):** BUILD_REPORT.md + CHANGELOG.md brought to
  v3.0.x reality; SMOKE_TEST.md synced (§12 roving-tabindex note); CONTEXT.md
  end-of-sprint snapshot; DECISIONS D-018 → **D-019** renumber to clear a
  D-number collision with the unmerged `chore/dependabot-policy` branch (which
  owns D-018 for its majors-suppressed policy).

## [3.0.1] — Sprint 1 · smoke sweep — 2026-07-06

Branch `qa/smoke-sweep-sprint-1` (PR #16). A green Playwright smoke suite now
backs `SMOKE_TEST.md`, plus the runtime defects the sweep surfaced and fixed.

- 14-file / 27-test Playwright suite under `e2e/smoke/` covering SMOKE_TEST
  sections 0–15 (home, signup errors, self-assessment, tech-debt, ATT&CK, ZT,
  CSF Playbook, risk register, messaging, staleness, a11y nav, not-found,
  tenant isolation, security headers).
- **D-017 — fixture-mode AI:** deterministic offline suggestions for all five
  AI purposes (`mitre_map`, `zt_score`, `csf_score`, `extract.capabilities`,
  `risk_synthesize`) so the demo stack is fully exercisable with no provider key.
- **D-016 — typed registration errors:** `{reason, message}` envelope mapped to
  field-scoped friendly copy on the sign-up form.
- Missing ATT&CK coverage PATCH proxy route added; assorted runtime fixes the
  sweep found. Full detail in `SPRINT_1.md` and the PR #16 description.

## [3.0.0] — v2 work order (Parts A–F) — merged via PR #1

The v2 work order (migrations 0015–0025) shipped all four assessment services
end-to-end, multi-tenant consultant-led onboarding, the AI job registry behind
the single redacting egress client, and the deterministic engines (CSF Playbook
`app/csf/playbook.py`, Risk Register `app/risk/engine.py`, ZT scoring
`app/zt/scoring.py`) — "AI suggests, code computes." Part F added the hardening
pass (synchronous AI runs, dependency audits + Dependabot, cross-tenant
isolation tests, production Dockerfiles). See DECISIONS.md D-021 (Part F;
renumbered from a duplicate D-015 heading, erratum D-022) and
the granular history below.

## Earlier build history — v0.x foundation → v2 work order

The phase-by-phase log below (Phases 1–3, `v0.x`) records the original
autonomous build and the incremental v2 evolution (multi-tenant, D-015) that
the Parts A–F work order completed and PR #1 merged as `v3.0.0`. `[Unreleased]`
labels in this section are historical.

### Multi-tenant: allow many clients per deployment — 2026-05-21

- Added `client_id` to `services`, `service_requests`, `artifacts` (Alembic 0013); made `client_id` `NOT NULL` on `csf_assessments`, `csf_answers`, `zt_assessments`, `zt_answers`, `attack_assessments`, `attack_coverage` after backfill from the deployment's existing singleton client (or a placeholder `(legacy backfill)` client when business data exists but no `client` row does).
- `User.client_id` stays nullable (platform admin/reviewer = `NULL`; client-role users get a fresh client created and bound at registration). Indexed for filtering speed.
- New FastAPI dependency `current_client` resolves the active tenant per request: client-role users are pinned to `user.client_id`; admin/reviewer users pick a tenant via the `X-Client-Id` header.
- `app/tenant.py` introduces `require_*_in_tenant` helpers used by every data route (CSF, ZT, ATT&CK, tech-debt, artifacts, deliverables); cross-tenant id-based access returns 404 with no existence oracle.
- New admin endpoints: `GET/POST /admin/clients`, `GET /admin/clients/{id}`. `GET /admin/intake-queue` now optional-filters by `client_id` and shows cross-tenant rows by default.
- Frontend: added `ClientSwitcher` to the top nav for admin/reviewer roles; the selection is persisted in a `shield_active_client_id` cookie (`httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`) and `lib/api.ts` forwards it as `X-Client-Id` to the FastAPI backend on every proxied call. New route handler `POST /api/active-client` sets the cookie.
- See DECISIONS.md D-015 for the architectural rationale.

### Opening commit — 2026-05-19

- Repo scaffolded per Master Spec §16 and AI Prompt §8.
- Reference documents relocated to `reference-docs/` with normalized filenames (see DECISIONS.md D-013).
- Dev container configured with `appuser` + passwordless sudo per AI Prompt §3.10–§3.11.
- Docker Compose stack defined for 8 services (db, redis, minio, keycloak, mailhog, api, worker, web).
- Pre-commit hooks and CI workflow seeded per AI Prompt §5 / §8.6.
- Documentation skeleton seeded under `docs/`.
- Seven spec §17 open questions answered in DECISIONS.md (D-003 through D-009); Q5 flipped to full ATT&CK matrix per Eugene's direction.

### Phase 1 stage 1 — API skeleton (`v0.1.1`) — 2026-05-19

- FastAPI app factory with lifespan (`apps/api/app/main.py`).
- Structured JSON logging via `structlog` with merged correlation-IDs (`apps/api/app/logging.py`).
- `CorrelationIdMiddleware` reads/echoes `X-Request-ID` (validated; 1–128 chars, alnum + `-_`).
- Global exception handler returns correlation-ID-only 500 responses; stack traces never leak (Master Spec §6.3).
- `app.config.Settings` (pydantic-settings) loads every env var, refuses production with `SHIELD_REDACTION_MODE=off` or placeholder `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET`.
- SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic wiring (`alembic.ini`, `alembic/env.py`, `script.py.mako`), shared metadata naming convention.
- `/health` liveness endpoint.
- Runtime Dockerfile under `apps/api/Dockerfile` with least-privilege `shield` user (uid 10001), no shell, no sudo (production posture per AI Prompt §3.10 note).
- Unit tests (9 passing): health, correlation-ID middleware, exception handler, config safety asserts.

### Phase 1 stage 2 — Data model + audit log (`v0.1.2`) — 2026-05-19

- ORM models for the three Phase 1 tables: `client` (singleton org), `users` (with `UserRole` enum: admin/reviewer/client), `audit_entries` (append-only) — `apps/api/app/models/`.
- Cross-dialect first Alembic migration (`alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py`): creates tables on both Postgres and SQLite; installs Postgres-only `audit_entries_block_mutation()` trigger function + `BEFORE UPDATE`/`BEFORE DELETE` triggers.
- Application-layer append-only guard: `SQLAlchemy` `before_flush` event listener raises `AuditEntryImmutableError` on any update or delete of an `AuditEntry`. Catches logic bugs even when running against SQLite or if the prod trigger is somehow missing.
- `app.audit.spine.audit()` is the only blessed write surface for audit rows; automatically merges the current correlation ID from the request context.
- `/ready` readiness probe that touches the DB (`SELECT 1`) and reports per-dependency status (returns 200 with `status=degraded` rather than 5xx, so load balancers get a clean signal but readiness sweeps stay green).
- Alembic env honors any `sqlalchemy.url` already set in the config (tests override it for SQLite).
- 16 unit tests passing: migration applies cleanly on SQLite; ORM round-trips a User + audit row; audit immutability fires on UPDATE and DELETE; client singleton inserts; `audit()` row carries correlation_id; everything from stage 1 still green.

### Phase 1 stage 3 — Auth backbone (`v0.1.3`) — 2026-05-19

- Argon2id password hashing tuned per OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet (`apps/api/app/security/password.py`).
- HS256 JWT issue + verify with typed claims (`apps/api/app/security/jwt.py`); separate access / refresh `typ` claim; `verify_token(expected_type=...)` prevents token-confusion attacks.
- Lockout bookkeeping columns added to `users` via migration `0002_user_lockout_columns.py`: `failed_login_count`, `last_failed_login_at`, `locked_until_at`. 10 failed attempts in 15 minutes locks the account (Master Spec §4.5).
- Auth routes (`apps/api/app/routes/auth.py`):
  - `POST /auth/register` — self-registration per D-004. First registrant becomes Primary POC with `admin` role; subsequent registrants are `client`.
  - `POST /auth/login` — email + password. Account-existence oracle defended (wrong-email runs a dummy Argon2 verify so timing matches wrong-password).
  - `POST /auth/refresh` — refresh token → new access + refresh pair. Refuses access tokens.
  - `POST /auth/logout` — audited.
  - `GET /auth/me` — current user.
- `current_user` FastAPI dependency: validates `Authorization: Bearer <access>` and loads the user (`apps/api/app/dependencies.py`).
- 14 new auth route tests + 13 primitive tests = 43 unit tests all passing.

### Phase 1 stage 4 — Keycloak realm (`v0.1.4`) — 2026-05-19

- `infra/keycloak/shield-realm.json` imported on `keycloak` service start (compose mounts the dir at `/opt/keycloak/data/import` and starts with `--import-realm`).
- Realm + 3 realm roles (admin / reviewer / client) + 2 clients (`shield-web` public OIDC w/ PKCE S256, `shield-api` bearer-only).
- Brute-force protection mirrors API lockout counters (10 failures, 60s/900s waits).
- SSO session idle 1800s, max 86400s — matches Master Spec §4.5.
- Bootstrap dev-admin user with temporary password (dev only).

### Phase 1 stage 5 — Next.js skeleton (`v0.1.5`) — 2026-05-19

- `apps/web` baseline: Next.js 14.2 App Router + React 18 + TS strict + Tailwind 3.4 + NextAuth 4.24.
- `next.config.mjs` ships `output: "standalone"` for slim prod image, security headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, HSTS, Permissions-Policy, no `X-Powered-By`).
- NextAuth Credentials provider (`src/lib/auth/options.ts`) posts to `/auth/login` on the API and stores access + refresh tokens in the encrypted JWT session. 401/423 from the API map to `null` (sign-in failure); other errors propagate.
- Server-side `apiFetch<T>()` helper (`src/lib/api.ts`) attaches Bearer tokens, surfaces correlation IDs from `X-Request-ID`, raises `ApiError` with status + payload on non-2xx.
- Typed session augmentation in `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` exposes `session.role` and `session.accessToken`.
- Placeholder landing at `/` (real Round-6 landing arrives in stage 7).
- Smoke: `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` succeeded — 4 routes built (`/`, `/_not-found`, `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`), 87.2 kB First Load JS shared.

### Phase 1 stage 6 — Design-system primitives (`v0.1.6`) — 2026-05-19

- New workspace package `@shield/design-system` (`packages/design-system/`).
- Round-6 tokens in `src/tokens.css` as CSS custom properties: surface, ink, border, brand navy, status palette (saturated colors reserved for status per Round-6), type scale, 4-px spacing scale, radii, soft shadows, motion tokens that collapse under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Tailwind preset (`src/tailwind-preset.ts`) wires the tokens to classnames.
- 8 primitives, all keyboard-accessible and WCAG-2.1-AA-targeted:
  - `Card` + sub-parts — modular, soft shadow.
  - `StatusPill` — saturated colors only here per Round-6.
  - `NumberCard` — KPI card for executive surfaces.
  - `DataTable` — sticky header, sortable columns with `aria-sort`, row click, empty-state slot.
  - `Toast` + `ToastProvider` + `useToast()` — `aria-live=polite` region, auto-dismiss.
  - `Modal` + `SlideOver` — native `<dialog>` (browser focus trap + ESC), backdrop click closes.
  - `EmptyState` — icon + title + description + action slot.
- Wired into `apps/web`: package dep, Tailwind preset, token CSS import, placeholder `/` now uses `Card` + `StatusPill`.
- Smoke: `pnpm typecheck` clean across workspace; `pnpm build` succeeded — `/` route now 8.57 kB First Load JS (up from 138 B placeholder); 4 routes, 87.1 kB shared.

### Phase 1 stage 7 — Landing + auth screens (`v0.1.7`) — 2026-05-19

- Marketing landing (`/`): `PublicHeader` + `Hero` + `ServiceGrid` (4 service cards using `Card` from `@shield/design-system`) + trust strip with `StatusPill`s + `PublicFooter`. Round-6 PUBLIC EXPERIENCE tier.
- `/sign-in`: NextAuth Credentials-backed form (`SignInForm`) wrapped in `<Suspense>` (uses `useSearchParams` for `callbackUrl`). Errors render inline; 401/423 from the API surface as "Invalid email or password" to avoid an account-existence oracle.
- `/sign-up`: form (`SignUpForm`) posting to `/api/proxy/auth/register`, which proxies to the FastAPI `/auth/register` via the server-side `apiFetch` helper. On success, immediately calls `signIn("credentials")` so the user lands in an authenticated session.
- `/api/proxy/auth/register`: thin server route that keeps API host names off the wire to the browser and maps `ApiError` → `NextResponse` with the upstream status preserved.
- Footer pages stubbed at `/accessibility`, `/privacy`, `/security` so the footer nav doesn't 404; each carries a real mailto contact for the relevant team.
- `AuthSessionProvider` (NextAuth `SessionProvider`) and `ToastProvider` wired into the root layout.
- `next.config.mjs` `typedRoutes` left OFF intentionally (requires `next build` to populate the route manifest before `tsc --noEmit`, which we run as a pre-build smoke).
- Smoke: `pnpm typecheck` clean across workspace; `pnpm build` succeeded — 9 routes total (`/`, `/_not-found`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/accessibility`, `/privacy`, `/security`, `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`, `/api/proxy/auth/register`). First Load JS shared 87.2 kB; biggest route (`/sign-up`) at 105 kB.

### Phase 1 stage 8 — CI green (`v0.1.8`) — 2026-05-19

- All linters and formatters configured and clean across the whole tree:
  - **Python:** `ruff` (curated rule set, with TCH dropped because SQLAlchemy 2's `Mapped[uuid.UUID]` etc. need their referent types resolvable at runtime; per-file ignores for test fixtures and Alembic env), `black`, `bandit` (0 issues), `pytest -m unit` (43 passing). Targeted `# noqa` for FastAPI's `Depends(...)` default and the OAuth `token_type="bearer"` field (false positives, not credentials).
  - **Web:** `prettier --check`, `eslint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` (9 routes). Added `.prettierignore` so the lockfile and `reference-docs/` are not reformatted.
- CI workflow rewritten (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to actually run those checks against the codebase. Three jobs: `python` (ruff, black, pytest, bandit), `web` (prettier, eslint, typecheck, build), `secret-scan` (gitleaks).
- `apps/api/app/models/user.py`: `UserRole(str, Enum)` → `UserRole(StrEnum)` (Python 3.11+ idiom; what ruff UP042 wanted).

## Phase 1 — Foundation — Complete (`v0.1.0`) — 2026-05-19

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] User can self-register, sign in. (MFA + email verification deferred per Master Spec §2 risk acceptance; columns + feature flags in place to enable in v1.x.)
- [x] Three roles distinguishable (admin / reviewer / client).
- [x] Audit log records every login (and registration, lockout, logout).
- [x] No stack trace surfaces to user under any forced error.

### Notable features shipped

- API skeleton with structured JSON logs and correlation IDs end-to-end.
- Data model for `client` (singleton), `users` (with role enum + lockout bookkeeping), `audit_entries` (append-only at two layers).
- Auth backbone: Argon2id hashing, JWT issue/verify, register/login/refresh/logout/me routes, account lockout, account-existence oracle defense.
- Keycloak realm exported and ready for v1.x OIDC federation with the same audience claim.
- Next.js 14 web app: marketing landing (Round-6 PUBLIC EXPERIENCE), sign-in + sign-up, NextAuth Credentials provider, security headers, footer stub pages.
- `@shield/design-system` package: Round-6 tokens, Tailwind preset, 8 keyboard-accessible primitives (Card, StatusPill, NumberCard, DataTable, Toast, Modal, SlideOver, EmptyState).
- CI green across the whole tree: ruff, black, bandit, pytest, prettier, eslint, tsc, next build.

### Security review (OWASP Top 10) — see BUILD_REPORT.md for full matrix

- A01 Access Control: PARTIAL (authn done; role-based route guards in Phase 2)
- A02 Cryptographic Failures: PASS
- A03 Injection: PASS
- A04 Insecure Design: PASS
- A05 Misconfiguration: PASS
- A06 Vulnerable Components: PARTIAL (pinned versions; audit hooks in Phase 6)
- A07 Auth Failures: PASS WITH NOTES (MFA deferred per spec)
- A08 Software Integrity: PASS
- A09 Logging and Monitoring: PASS
- A10 SSRF: PASS

### What's stubbed or deferred

- MFA enrollment + email verification — feature-flagged off; columns and feature flags ready.
- Postgres audit-trigger integration smoke — waits on Docker availability in the dev container.
- axe-core / Playwright accessibility CI job — deferred to Phase 6 hardening; WCAG 2.1 AA is implemented at the component layer.
- Redactor module (`apps/api/app/ai/redact.py`) — lands in Phase 3 with the first AI-extraction use case (Tech Debt capability list).

### Known issues

- None blocking Phase 2.

### How to try it

1. `cp .env.example .env`; paste `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (only needed when `SHIELD_LLM_MODE=live`); generate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` via `openssl rand -hex 32`.
2. `docker compose up -d db redis minio keycloak mailhog && docker compose up -d --build api worker`.
3. `docker compose run --service-ports --rm web bash scripts/dev-web.sh`.
4. Open http://localhost:3000.

### Decisions logged this phase

- D-001 through D-014 (opening commit). No new decisions added during stages 1–9 beyond DECISIONS.md entries already on `main`.

## [Unreleased — Phase 2 in progress]

### Phase 2 stage 1 — Intake data model (`v0.2.1`) — 2026-05-19

- New `ServiceRequest` ORM model (`apps/api/app/models/service_request.py`) matching Master Spec §11: `service_type`, `requested_by`, `requested_at`, `notes`, `deadline`, `fulfilled_service_id`, `declined_at`, `declined_reason`.
- New `ServiceType(StrEnum)`: `tech_debt`, `zero_trust_cisa`, `zero_trust_dod`, `nist_csf`, `attack_coverage`, `consultation`. The fifth-option "I'm not sure" intake path maps to `CONSULTATION`.
- `Client.intake_completed_at` column added so the admin queue can surface new leads with a real timestamp (Phase 2 acceptance).
- `Client.service_interests` switched to `ARRAY(String(32)).with_variant(JSONB, "sqlite")` for SQLite test compatibility.
- Migration `0003_intake.py`: adds the column, creates `service_requests` + indexes on `(requested_at)` and `(service_type)`.
- 5 new unit tests (48 total).

### Phase 2 stage 2 — Intake API routes (`v0.2.2`) — 2026-05-19

- Three routes on the FastAPI side back the wizard (`apps/api/app/routes/intake.py`):
  - `GET /intake` — current state; lazily creates the singleton client placeholder so the wizard always has a target.
  - `PATCH /intake` — auto-save target on every blur. Accepts a sparse body; only set-and-non-None fields are applied (avoids overwriting NOT-NULL columns like `users.timezone` with None).
  - `POST /intake/submit` — finalizes submission: validates a real legal name, writes `ServiceRequest` rows (dedupes by service_type), stamps `client.intake_completed_at = utcnow()`, and writes a `client.intake_submitted` audit row whose `details.services` are sorted for stable diffing.
- `IntakePatchRequest` / `IntakeSubmitRequest` / `IntakeStateResponse` Pydantic schemas (`apps/api/app/schemas/intake.py`). `IntakeSubmitRequest.service_requests` enforces `min_length=1`; `consultation` is a valid first pick so the "I'm not sure" path doesn't get blocked.
- 7 new route tests (55 total): GET creates the singleton, PATCH writes partial updates, submit writes service_requests + audit row, submit rejects empty service list, submit rejects the pending placeholder legal name, submit dedupes duplicates, all three routes return 401 when unauthenticated.

### Phase 2 stage 3 — Web intake wizard skeleton (`v0.2.3`) — 2026-05-19

- `/intake` route gated by `getServerSession()` in `app/intake/layout.tsx`; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in?callbackUrl=/intake`.
- `IntakeWizard` client component manages step state (`services` → `organization` → `contact` → `systems` → `notes` → `review`) and pulls the current intake from `/api/proxy/intake` on mount. If the intake is already submitted, jumps to `review` so the user can verify what's on file instead of re-starting.
- `IntakeProgress` renders a 6-step indicator with `aria-current="step"`, success-tone tick marks for completed steps, focus-tone for the current step, and ink-tertiary for upcoming steps.
- `SaveStatus` reads a discriminated `SaveState` (`idle | saving | saved | error`) and renders an `aria-live=polite` indicator with "Saved X seconds/minutes ago" that updates once a second.
- Server-side proxy routes (`/api/proxy/intake`, `/api/proxy/intake/submit`) attach the session's access token as a Bearer header and forward to FastAPI; ApiError shapes pass through with the upstream status preserved.
- Client-side wrappers (`lib/intake/client.ts`) cover `fetchIntake`, `patchIntake`, `submitIntake` with typed return values; per-step forms in stage 4 call these.
- TS types in `lib/intake/types.ts` mirror `apps/api/app/schemas/intake.py` 1:1; `SERVICE_LABELS` gives the plain-English copy the wizard renders (Master Spec §15 Phase 2: "All copy in plain English").
- Smoke: typecheck clean, eslint 0 warnings, prettier clean, `next build` clean — now 12 routes total (3 new: `/intake`, `/api/proxy/intake`, `/api/proxy/intake/submit`). `/intake` is server-rendered on demand (dynamic) because it reads the session at request time.

### Phase 2 stage 4 — Per-step form fields + real auto-save (`v0.2.4`) — 2026-05-19

- `useIntakeAutoSave` hook wraps `patchIntake` with a discriminated `SaveState` and surfaces the updated intake state back to the wizard via an `onUpdate` callback.
- Six step components (`apps/web/src/components/intake/steps/Step*.tsx`):
  - **Step 1 — Services:** card-grid of the 6 service types with USWDS-style checkboxes. Picking "I'm not sure" is exclusive (clears the four real services); picking a real service clears "I'm not sure". Each card is keyboard-focusable; descriptions are wired via `aria-describedby`.
  - **Step 2 — Organization:** legal_name (required) + dba_name + website + size_band (`<select>`) + industry, plus 6-field address block. Every input is wired to PATCH on blur.
  - **Step 3 — Contact:** display_name + title + phone + timezone for the user. Email shown read-only with hint copy (locked to the signed-in account).
  - **Step 4 — Systems:** single textarea writing to `client.prompting_context`. Real systems table comes in Phase 4 with the CSF assessment.
  - **Step 5 — Notes:** per-picked-service notes + optional target deadline. Lives in wizard local state until submit (the API only writes `service_requests` at POST `/intake/submit`).
  - **Step 6 — Review:** read-only summary (organization / services / context). Submit button disabled unless legal_name is real and at least one service is picked. Pre-existing `intake_completed_at` surfaces as "submitted on …; you can re-submit" copy.
- New `Field` component (`apps/web/src/components/intake/Field.tsx`) wires label / hint / error with `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` per USWDS accessibility patterns. Exports shared Tailwind class strings (`inputClasses`, `textareaClasses`, `selectClasses`) so every input renders identically.
- `IntakeWizard` rewires the placeholder step renderer to dispatch to the real step components; submit handler bundles client state + service_inputs into `POST /intake/submit` and reflects the response.
- Smoke: typecheck clean, ESLint 0 warnings, prettier clean, `next build` clean — `/intake` route now 8.0 kB (up from 3.56 kB), 112 kB First Load JS. 12 routes total; no schema changes so the 55 API unit tests still pass.

### Phase 2 stage 5 — Section-tabbed questionnaire renderer (`v0.2.5`) — 2026-05-19

- New `@/components/questionnaire` module — the shared rendering primitive that Phases 4 (CSF) and 5 (ATT&CK with the full ~600-technique matrix per D-007) will both consume. Master Spec §15 Phase 2: "Section-tabbed questionnaire renderer (shared component for CSF, ZT, future frameworks)."
- **`QuestionnaireDefinition` shape:** JSON-friendly (so it can ship as static assets in `packages/csf-data` / `packages/attack-data` / `packages/zt-data`). Sections contain questions; each question carries a stable id used as the key in a flat `Responses` map (matches the `questionnaire_responses` table shape from Master Spec §11).
- **Eight question primitives** cover the v1 surface: `short_text`, `long_text`, `number` (with optional `unit`), `score_0_2` (named-label radio group for CSF 5-dimension scoring + ATT&CK coverage), `choice` (single-select), `multi` (multi-checkbox), `yes_no`, `tristate` (yes/no/n-a). Specialized CSF grid composes these in Phase 4.
- **`SectionTabs`** has full WAI-ARIA APG tab semantics: `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, roving `tabIndex`, plus full keyboard nav (ArrowLeft / ArrowRight / Home / End) with manual activation. Per-section completion chips drive a small progress percentage.
- **`QuestionnaireRenderer`** renders the active section as a `role="tabpanel"` with `aria-labelledby` wired to the active tab. Computes `sectionProgress` via `useMemo` from the responses map — Phase 4 reuses this for the "needs answers" badge on the admin queue.
- **Dev preview** at `/dev/questionnaire-preview` exercises every question type end-to-end with a hand-rolled definition (3 sections, 10 questions). Unlisted route; the page header makes the dev-only nature obvious.
- Smoke: typecheck clean, ESLint 0 warnings, prettier clean, `next build` clean. 13 routes total (1 new: `/dev/questionnaire-preview`).

### Phase 2 stage 6 — Document upload + redaction disclosure (`v0.2.6`) — 2026-05-19

- Storage abstraction (`apps/api/app/storage/`): `StorageBackend` Protocol with `LocalFilesystemStorage` for tests/dev and `S3Storage` for production (KMS-encrypted, boto3 imported lazily).
- `Artifact` model + migration `0004_artifacts.py` matching Master Spec §11 (origin enum, indexes on uploaded_at / uploaded_by / sha256).
- Three API routes: `POST /artifacts` (multipart, MIME allowlist, 50 MB cap, filename sanitization, sha256 + audit row), `GET /artifacts` (current user's uploads), `GET /artifacts/{id}` (404 for unknown id or wrong owner).
- Server-side multipart proxy `/api/proxy/artifacts` forwards FormData with the session bearer; browser never sees the API host name.
- Web components: `Dropzone` (drag/drop + click + keyboard, multi-file, per-file status with `aria-label`), `RedactionDisclosure` (plain-English copy of §12 policy), `EmptyArtifactsHint`.
- Wired into intake **Step 5** above the per-service notes: redaction disclosure → dropzone → live upload list (refreshes on mount via `GET /artifacts`).
- 7 new pytest tests (62 total): upload writes row + storage object + audit; rejects unknown MIME (415); rejects empty (422); sanitizes path-traversal filenames; list returns own only; GET unknown id 404; routes 401 without auth.
- Smoke: pytest 62/62 green, ruff + black + bandit clean, prettier + ESLint + tsc clean, `next build` clean. 14 routes total.

### Phase 2 stage 7 — Admin queue (`v0.2.7`) — 2026-05-19

- `require_role(*allowed)` FastAPI dependency factory (`apps/api/app/dependencies.py`) returns 403 (not 401) when authenticated callers lack the required role — matches RFC 7231 and lets clients distinguish "sign in" from "you're signed in but not allowed".
- `GET /admin/intake-queue` (`apps/api/app/routes/admin.py`) returns the singleton client (with `intake_completed_at`), all service requests (with requester user summary joined in), all artifacts, and the total user count. Per Master Spec §15 Phase 2 acceptance: the admin queue surfaces the new-lead timestamp and reflects exactly what the client entered.
- `AdminUserSummary` schema redacts password hash + lockout state but keeps the identity bits the consultant needs (email, display name, title, role, last_login_at).
- Server-side proxy `/api/proxy/admin/intake-queue` attaches the session bearer.
- `/admin/queue` page gated by `app/admin/layout.tsx`: redirects to `/sign-in?callbackUrl=/admin/queue` if unauthenticated; renders a "Not authorized" landing if signed in as a non-admin (session intact so navigation elsewhere works).
- `IntakeQueue` component (`apps/web/src/components/admin/IntakeQueue.tsx`) renders the organization panel, service requests list (with `Open`/`Fulfilled`/`Declined` `StatusPill` per row + the requester's name/email/title), and uploaded documents. Empty states for no-intake-yet and no-service-requests.
- `PublicHeader` is now an async Server Component: shows "Intake" + "Admin queue" (admin-only) when signed in, sign-in/get-started CTAs when not. Surfaces the signed-in user's email.
- 4 new pytest tests (66 total): empty queue, reflects submitted intake with requester summary, client role gets 403, unauthenticated gets 401.
- Smoke: pytest 66/66 green, ruff + black + bandit clean, prettier + ESLint + tsc clean, `next build` clean. 16 routes total (2 new: `/admin/queue`, `/api/proxy/admin/intake-queue`).

### Phase 2 stage 8 — Notifications + Phase 2 acceptance gate (`v0.2.8` / `v0.2.0`) — 2026-05-19

- `Notification` model + migration `0005_notifications.py` matching Master Spec §11: user_id, event_type, title, body, link, created_at, read_at. Indexes on `(user_id, created_at)` and `(user_id, read_at)` so per-user list + unread count both stay index-backed.
- `notify(...)` and `notify_role(role, ...)` helpers (`apps/api/app/notifications/spine.py`) — blessed write surface, mirrors the audit-spine pattern. `notify_role` fans out one row per user with the given role.
- Three notification routes: `GET /notifications` (newest first, capped at 50, returns `unread_count`); `POST /notifications/{id}/read` (404 for unknown id or wrong owner); `POST /notifications/read-all`.
- **Intake submit now fans out a `intake.submitted` admin notification** with `link=/admin/queue` (AI Prompt §6.12: bell links must resolve to a working page). Body includes the client legal name + sorted services list.
- 6 new pytest tests (72 total): intake submit writes admin notification; submitter (client role) does NOT get a copy; `GET /notifications` reflects unread count; mark-read updates `read_at` and clears unread count; cross-user mark-read returns 404; all routes 401 without auth.

## Phase 2 — Intake — Complete (`v0.2.0`) — 2026-05-19

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] A new client can complete intake end-to-end without internal vocabulary, raw JSON, or stack traces.
- [x] Submitting intake reflects correctly in the admin queue with the new-lead timestamp.
- [x] All intake data round-trips correctly: client enters X, admin reads X.

### Notable features shipped

- Self-service 6-step intake wizard with auto-save on every blur and a live "Saved Xs ago" indicator.
- Drag-and-drop document upload with up-front redaction disclosure (the user-facing copy of the Master Spec §12 policy).
- Generic section-tabbed questionnaire renderer with full WAI-ARIA tab semantics — load-bearing for Phases 4 and 5.
- Admin queue at `/admin/queue` with role-based authz; reflects the singleton client + every service request (with requester user joined in) + every uploaded document.
- Admin notification fan-out on intake submit, with link pointing at `/admin/queue`.
- 72 unit tests across the API; web typecheck + lint + prettier + next build all green.

### Security review (OWASP Top 10) — full matrix in BUILD_REPORT.md

- A01 Access Control: PASS (role-based guards at route + layout layer)
- A02 Cryptographic Failures: PASS
- A03 Injection: PASS
- A04 Insecure Design: PASS (audit immutability, MIME allowlist, redaction disclosure)

- A08 Software & Data Integrity: PASS (sha256 captured + audited on upload)
- A09 Logging & Monitoring: PASS (audit + notification fan-out)
- A10 SSRF: PASS

### What's stubbed or deferred

- Notification bell UI in the header — API + data layer shipped; visual surfacing is a small follow-up.
- Postgres audit-trigger integration smoke — waits on Docker availability.
- The redactor module — lands in Phase 3 with the first AI extraction (Tech Debt capability list).

### Known issues

- None blocking Phase 3.

### How to try it

A SQLite-only dev demo is documented in BUILD_REPORT.md ("Recommended next steps"). For the full stack: `cp .env.example .env`, paste `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, generate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, then `docker compose up`.

### Decisions logged this phase

- No new DECISIONS.md entries beyond stages tracked in this CHANGELOG; the seven §17 open questions were already settled in Phase 1's D-003 through D-009.

## [Unreleased — Phase 3 in progress]

### Phase 3 stage 1 — Tech Debt data model (`v0.3.1`) — 2026-05-19

- New ORM models matching Master Spec §11 verbatim:
  - **`Service`** — the workspace that opens when an admin promotes a `ServiceRequest` to live work. Carries `kind` (StrEnum: `tech_debt` / `zero_trust_cisa` / `zero_trust_dod` / `nist_csf` / `attack_coverage`), `status` (`draft`/`in_progress`/`review`/`released`/`archived`), `title`, `source_request_id` (FK back to the originating request), `opened_by`, `released_at`. Other service kinds are listed in the enum so Phase 4 + 5 don't need a schema change.
  - **`CapabilityList`** — versioned per service (unique constraint on `(service_id, version)`); `draft` / `approved` / `released` status.
  - **`CapabilityItem`** — `name` / `vendor` / `category` / `function` / `annual_cost_usd` (Numeric(14,2)) / `license_count` / `notes` / `confidence_pct` (0-100, AI-set; cleared on human edit) / `source_artifact_id` (FK to the uploaded artifact the item was extracted from).
  - **`Deliverable`** — `service_id`, `title`, `summary`, `version`, `pdf_artifact_id`, `xlsx_artifact_id`, `finalized_at`/`finalized_by`, `released_to_client_at`, `superseded_by` (self-FK for re-releases).
- Migration `0006_tech_debt.py`: creates all four tables + indexes (`services.kind`, `services.status`, `capability_items.capability_list_id`, `deliverables.service_id`, `deliverables.released_to_client_at`).
- 3 new pytest tests (75 total): migration creates Phase 3 tables; full round-trip through Service → CapabilityList → CapabilityItem → Deliverable with realistic financial data; unique-constraint on `(service_id, version)` enforced.

### Phase 3 stage 2 — PII redactor (`v0.3.2`) — 2026-05-19

- **`app.ai.redact`** module — the §12 security boundary in front of every LLM call. Intentionally pure (no I/O, no DB, no clock) so it can be reviewed line-by-line in an OWASP audit.
- Two public functions: `redact_for_ai(text, *, mode, client_org_name, name_hints)` for strings and `redact_payload(obj, ...)` that walks dicts/lists/tuples recursively. Both return `(cleaned, removed_counts)` — the counts dict (e.g. `{"email": 3, "phone": 1}`) is what `artifact_redactions.removed_items` (Master Spec §11) and the `llm_calls` audit row both record. **Counts only, never payload content.**
- Eight categories redacted in `strict` mode: emails, phones (US + international, 10–20 char digit-run-with-separators), SSNs, EINs, CAGE codes (introducer-keyword form only), govcon contract numbers (e.g. `W91QUZ-23-C-0001`), street addresses + Suite/Apt/PO Box, signature blocks (everything from `Sincerely,` / `Regards,` / `V/R` etc. onwards), name hints supplied by the caller, and the client's org name.
- `standard` mode keeps addresses + org name (when the prompt explicitly needs the org context).
- `off` mode is pass-through. The runtime config refuses it outside development via `Settings.assert_safe_for_runtime()` (Phase 1); tests use it to compare raw-vs-redacted paths.
- Order of operations matters: signature block → email → SSN → EIN → contract → phone → CAGE → names → addresses → org. SSN runs before phone so `123-45-6789` is replaced with `[SSN]` before the phone pass sees it.
- 23 new pytest tests (98 total): every PII pattern + every mode + nested-payload walk + non-string-scalar preservation.

### Phase 3 stage 3 — AI client + `llm_calls` audit (`v0.3.3`) — 2026-05-19

- `app.ai.llm` module — the only path that calls an external AI provider. `LLMClient.invoke(...)` redacts the payload, opens an `llm_calls` row with `status=running` before the provider call, calls the provider, then finalizes with `status=completed | failed` + token counts + duration + `redacted_counts`.
- Two provider implementations: `FixtureProvider` (canned responses keyed by `purpose`; raises on unregistered purpose), `AnthropicProvider` (lazy SDK import; raises if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty).
- `LLMCall` model + migration `0007_llm_calls.py` matching Master Spec §11 verbatim. `redacted_counts` is JSONB on Postgres / JSON on SQLite — counts only, never payload content (§12.1). `correlation_id` auto-populates from the request-scoped contextvar.
- 5 new pytest tests (103 total): provider sees the **redacted** payload (raw email/SSN never reach it); completed row carries token counts; failed row carries `error_message` + `duration_ms`; dict keys (field names) preserved through redaction; unregistered fixture purpose raises a loud `KeyError`; correlation_id threaded from request context.

### Phase 3 stage 4 — Capability list ingest (`v0.3.4`) — 2026-05-19

- **First real LLM extraction.** Admin uploads a CSV/XLSX inventory; the route runs it through `LLMClient.invoke(purpose="extract.capabilities")` with strict redaction; the response becomes a versioned `CapabilityList` + `CapabilityItem` rows.
- `app.tech_debt.parsers` parses CSV (stdlib) and XLSX (openpyxl, lazy import) into row-dicts. Header row becomes the keys; up to 500 rows ship; a sentinel `__truncated__` marker rides at the end if the input was longer.
- `app.tech_debt.extract` builds the prompt (versioned `PROMPT_VERSION="v1"` so future prompt-shape changes don't silently regress past extractions; the version is recorded on the `llm_calls` row), assembles `{rows, context}` payload, and parses the JSON response. Response parser handles the common "LLM wrapped JSON in prose" case by stripping to the outermost `{...}`.
- Name hints + client org name are pulled from the deployment (every user's display name + email-local-part as name hints; the singleton client's legal name as `[CLIENT]`) so the redactor uses real deployment data, not hardcoded fixtures.
- Three routes (`/tech-debt/services`, `/tech-debt/services/{id}/capability-lists/extract`, `/tech-debt/services/{id}/capability-lists/latest`) — all admin-only via `require_role(UserRole.ADMIN)`.
- Versioning: each extract creates `version = max + 1`; the unique constraint from stage 1's migration enforces it.
- Bad-JSON path: extractor raises `ValueError`, route maps to **502 Bad Gateway** (the `llm_calls` row is already written, so the operator can debug; client error code is wrong here because it's the upstream provider that misbehaved).
- 8 new pytest tests (111 total): admin can open service; client role gets 403; full extract flow with PII in CSV → redacted payload reaches the FixtureProvider (verified end-to-end); subsequent extracts version incrementally; unsupported artifact MIME (PDF) returns 415; non-existent service returns 404; bad JSON from the LLM returns 502; latest-list is admin-only until release.
- Demo DB migrated to head; `openpyxl` added to the API dev environment.

### Phase 3 stage 5 — Editable extraction table (`v0.3.5`) — 2026-05-19

- Two new API routes:
  - `PATCH /tech-debt/capability-items/{id}` — partial-update; clears `confidence_pct` on every human edit (the row is no longer an AI guess); rejects edits on items in a released list (409); audit row `capability_item.edited` records the list of fields touched.
  - `POST /tech-debt/capability-lists/{id}/approve` — flips `status: draft → approved`, stamps `approved_at` + `approved_by`, audits.
- New web workspace at `/admin/services/{id}/tech-debt` (admin-gated by the existing `/admin` layout):
  - Inventory upload via the existing `Dropzone` + `RedactionDisclosure` (Phase 2 stage 6) — drop a CSV/XLSX, the workspace auto-runs `POST /tech-debt/services/{id}/capability-lists/extract`.
  - `EditableCapabilityTable` renders the AI-extracted rows as a **real editable table** (AI Prompt §6.2: no raw JSON in user-facing UI). Each cell auto-saves on blur via `PATCH`; per-row status pill flips to "Saving…" → "Saved" or "Save failed". Low-confidence rows (`confidence_pct < 70`) get a warning row tint.
  - Confidence pill per row: `Human-curated` (success, after edit) | `AI 85%+` (info) | `AI 70–84%` (warning) | `AI <70%` (neutral with warning row tint).
  - Header strip shows total cost, low-confidence count, and the **Approve list** button (disabled if already approved/released).
  - Released lists render read-only.
- Six new server-side proxies (`/api/proxy/tech-debt/*`) consolidated through a shared `_proxy.ts` helper that handles bearer attachment + `ApiError` mapping. Adding a new tech-debt proxy is now a 4-line file.
- 6 new pytest tests (117 total): patch clears confidence + persists edits, patch rejects empty body 422, patch 404 for unknown item, patch rejects client role 403, approve writes status + actor, approve 404 for unknown list.
